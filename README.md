AEM Test Suite
--------------

AEM Test Suite is a work in progress and it's designed to be a suite of acceptance, security, performance, and recovery tests. The idea is you can run this test suite (or parts of it) against an AEM environment, as a mechanism to validate the status of that environment.

Security tests are executed using [InSpec AEM Security profile](https://supermarket.chef.io/tools/inspec-aem-security). It covers the guideline described in [AEM security checklist](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-2/sites/administering/using/security-checklist.html).

* Install [PhantomJS](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist/tree/v1.17.0#installing-phantomjs)
* Run `make deps` to install dependencies
